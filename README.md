# tic_tac_toe
In this project i developed a console-based tic-tac-toe game in Ruby.

The game is played by two players, who, initially, input their names, and 
chosen symbols to represent them and the dimension of the board they would like
to play in.

After the players and the board have have been set up, the game begins. The 
players choose their moves by inputting the number of the "location" of the 
board they would like to play.

The game continues until a winning condition is met, or the all the locations
in the board have been filled. Once one of those conditions is met, the game 
ends, and the result is announced - either a win (and the winning player), or
a tie.
